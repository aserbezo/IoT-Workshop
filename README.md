# IoT-Workshop



### Business Problem:
A logistics company operates a fleet of vehicles for transporting goods across various regions. 
The company faces challenges in optimizing fleet operations, including managing fuel consumption, ensuring vehicle maintenance, tracking vehicle locations, and analyzing driving behaviors to reduce accidents and improve overall efficiency.


### Objective:
To implement a fleet management system that leverages IoT devices, IoT Hub, Databricks, Azure Stream Analytics, and Power BI to monitor and optimize vehicle operations in real-time, leading to cost savings, enhanced safety, and improved operational efficiency.


### Solution Components and Architecture:

### 1. IoT Device

Install IoT devices on each vehicle to collect telemetry data such as speed, fuel level, engine temperature, and GPS coordinates.

### 2. IoT Hub

Act as a central hub for ingesting data from all IoT devices installed in the vehicles.
Ensure secure and reliable communication between the IoT devices and the cloud.

### 3. Azure Stream Analytics

Process and analyze the real-time data streams from the IoT Hub.
Filter and transform the incoming data to extract valuable insights such as abnormal driving patterns, engine overheating alerts, or low fuel warnings.

### 4. Databricks

Perform advanced analytics and machine learning on the historical data to predict vehicle maintenance needs, optimize routes, and analyze driver behavior.
Provide a scalable environment to handle large volumes of data.

### 5. Power BI

Visualize the processed data and analytics results in interactive dashboards.
Enable fleet managers to monitor the status of the fleet in real-time and make data-driven decisions.


## Implementation Steps:

### Step 1: Set Up IoT Hub and Register IoT Devices
- Create IoT Hub:
Go to Azure Portal -> Create a new IoT Hub -> Fill in necessary details and create the hub.

- Register IoT Devices:

Navigate to your IoT Hub -> Devices -> Add new device -> Provide Device ID and create -> Note the connection string.
